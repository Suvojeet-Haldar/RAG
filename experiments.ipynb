The median is based on the income distribution of all households, including those with no income.\\nGini index: A summary measure of income \\ninequality. The Gini index varies from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating perfect equality, where there is a proportional distribution of income.

The District of \\nColumbia’s median household income ($101,027) was the high-est in the nation.
